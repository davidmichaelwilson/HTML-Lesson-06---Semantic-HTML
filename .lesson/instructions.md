# Instructions  

Create a 'section' for each part of the box model in your HTML document.

Give the sections a background color, at least 40px of padding on all sides, and 100px of margin on the top and bottom only.

*Remember, you'll have to go into your CSS, select the section elements, and apply the properties there.*
